<h4>External links</h4> 
As I build my resources through this platform I will continue to add external resources. Here are a few I can think of currently.

###### *Learn R*

[Data carpentry]("https://datacarpentry.org/") is a good starting point for coding and R.

###### *Learn git*

There are many videos out there. Here is [one]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9)

###### *Learn markdown*

A good markdown guide is [here]("http://www.markdowntutorial.com/")

###### *GitHub Pages*
Just the raw documentation, believe it or not it is pretty good  at [github pages]("https://pages.github.com/")

###### *My website*
Just the raw documentation, believe it or not it is pretty good at [github pages]("https://www.ssnhub.com/")
