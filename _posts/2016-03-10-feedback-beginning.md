    <p>As I am building this website and the resources surrounding my statistics work I will have and continue to made mistakes and miss points. I look forward to the feedback but am definitely a little worried.</p></div>

I am often not sure how best to manage feedback at the best of times. As I work in an open-source framework I will have to get better at it as my work is always easily accessible if you know where to look. This is the beginning of developing some guidelines for feedback both for me personally and for the website.

As a start, here are some personal notes from Hugh's talk at the University of Canberra today. Hugh is a founder of the [thinkwell series]("https://ithinkwell.com.au/"). I remember being introduced to the [writing guide](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop/turbocharge-your-writing) very early in my PhD.

## Kol aspects

There are many free notes and resources for the [thinkwell](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au) approach online including [books]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop") and [resources]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/resources"). I particularly liked these concepts from todays workshop.

#### The PhD comic

- A nice light-hearted comic

#### The Pareto Principle

The 80/20 rule

| Current | Final draft | Submitted |
| ----- | ----------- | --------- |
|       |             |        |
|       |             |        |
|       |             |        |



**80% rule is when you can’t tell if it is getting any better**

## Feedback

Good to think of feedback as free advice. Some of it might be good and some bad but you definitely don't listen to all the advice people try to give you. Good feedback is not meant to be taken personally.

### What to ask

- Make sure that the feedback you want is clearly explained
- If you don’t get the feedback you want, ask better questions
- Timing (active waiting)
  - set deadlines for the feedback
  - Reminder after 5-10days or send a reminder

## Dealing with comments

1. Split comments ups to ‘must does’ and ‘ideas’...

If the comments are instructions then do them but ask again if you are not sure what the answer is. In other words make sure you know what to do before you start doing it.

## My notes

- I am attempting to use small bits of writing and these sorts of issues in blog as well. With an overall goal of being able to produce 1 blog a day for myself and my supervisors at a later date if needed.
- Here `blogdown` can work alongside these resources in the future?

#### Interesting note

Tutorials on how to build and maintain the relationship between supervisor and student are very common. I do think that the [thinkwell](www.ithinkwell.com.au) resources are some of the best, however, dealing with these issues together is a constant challenge to mentally keep on top of.

I have found this particularly hard while learning `markdown`, `git` and `jekyll` and the suite of other open-source tools being using in leading graduate research.

As is I still have trouble with these things:

1. Missing deadlines because document is not good enough
2. Handing in incorrect/poor quality drafts
3. And the classic [imposter syndrome](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/services-imposter-syndrome) academics are always talking about
